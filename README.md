# ShapeGeneratorAndCalculator
Intakes sets of points and performs mathmatical operations on them


This program will start by presenting the user with a menu of options to select an option simply type the number and hit enter. 
When inputing points(X,Y) into the program you must do so in the order you want the program to connect the points.
What I mean by this is if for example I wanted to input points for a quadralteral and my points were (1,1),(4,4),(4,1),(1,4) 
then I would want to enter them in the order in which I want the program to draw the lines if you will. So I would eneter them 
in this order to get an accurate picture and calculations - (1,1),(4,1),(4,4),(1,4). The shape option is capable of an unlimited
amount of points so long as your willing to input them all in. It calculates the area of whatever your shape is by using 
something called the Shoelace formula. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula
Another rule is that the lines that you create with the points can't intersect as the program will not work if they do.
